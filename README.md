# MegaHack-CodeScape

## Inspiration: 
### CodeScape was inspired by the typical problem that developers have when converting pseudocode into real code. It's our opinion that planning and organizing your ideas before implementing them can be made easier by using pseudocode to visualize them. By utilizing ChatGPT, a AI tool, to read and produce code based on your pseudocode, CodeScape seeks to close the gap between planning and execution. 

## What it does: 
### Pseudocode may be entered into CodeScape and converted into actual code segments in any preferred programming language. This is accomplished by first translating the pseudocode into executable code using ChatGPT's skills to understand the logic and intent behind it. Users may choose the target programming language, submit their pseudocode, and get a code sample in return.
